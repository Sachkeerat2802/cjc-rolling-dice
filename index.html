                <h1>Multiplayer Rolling Dice Game</h1>
                <p>
                    Players take turns to roll a single dice as many times as
                    they wish, adding all roll results to a running total.<br />If
                    the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the
                    next player's turn. <br />If the player rolls any other
                    number, it is added to their turn total and the player's
                    turn continues. <br />If a player chooses to "hold", their
                    turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next
                    player's turn. <br />The first player to score 100 or more
                    points wins.
